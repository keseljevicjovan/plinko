## About the Game
Plinko is a simple physics-based game inspired by the popular game from *The Price is Right*. Balls drop from the top of the board and bounce off pegs before landing in scoring slots at the bottom. The aim is to watch where the balls land and enjoy the randomness of the results!

This project uses the **Pygame** library to handle graphics and physics simulation.
